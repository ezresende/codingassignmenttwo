                 <h2>DON QUIJOTE DE LA MANCHA</h2>

                    <div id="i">Quixote de la Mancha (Don Quijote de la Mancha in Castilian) is a book written by the Spaniard Miguel de Cervantes (1547-1616).

                        The original title and spelling was "El ingenioso hidalgo Don Quixote de La Mancha", with its first edition published in Madrid in 1605. It consists of 126 chapters, divided into two parts: the first appeared in 1605 and the other in 1615. <br>
                        <br>
                        The Spanish crown sponsored a four-volume revised edition by Joaqu√≠n Ibarra. Started in 1777, it was completed in 1780 with an initial print run of 1,600 copies. <br>
                        <br>
                        The book emerged in a period of great innovation and diversity on the part of Spanish fiction writers. He parodied chivalric romances that enjoyed immense popularity at the time and were already in decline at the time. In this work, the parody presents an unusual form. The protagonist, at a certain age, surrenders to reading these novels, loses his mind, believes that they were historically true and decides to become a knight errant. So go out into the world and live your own chivalric romance. While narrating the deeds of the Knight of the Sad Figure, Cervantes satirizes the precepts that governed the fantasy stories of those heroes. The story is presented in the form of a realistic novel.<br>
                        <br>
                        It is considered the greatest creation of Cervantes. The book is one of the first of the modern European languages and is considered by many to be the epitome of Spanish literature. In early May 2002, the book was chosen as the best work of fiction of all time. The voting was organized by the Norwegian Book Clubs and internationally recognized writers participated.</div>
